# Train-Localization
Nowadays a hectic problem around the world is about traffic densities. This is also common to railway sectors too. Recent years we often hearing the word train collision and it bags huge precious human life and time. Travel time information is a vital component of many intelligent transportation systems (ITS) applications. Large cities with fleet of vehicles require a system to determine location of movement of passenger vehicles at a given time. With great passion regarding this issue, this paper deals with the simple sensor based train location identification system using optimized street tracking algorithm. The method introduced in this paper utilizes GPS data only for training purpose and not for testing. So without using GPS train location can be identified in an efficient manner. This method is incorporated with the advanced LPC1768 ARM processor to improve the performance of the processor.
